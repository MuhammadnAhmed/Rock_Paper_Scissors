# Rock Paper Scissor
"Rock Paper Scissors" is a classic hand game played by two people. The game is simple: each player selects either rock, paper, or scissors, and the outcomes of the game are determined by the following rules:

1. Rock beats scissors (rock crushes scissors)
2. Scissors beats paper (scissors cuts paper)
3. Paper beats rock (paper covers rock)

In this Python project, I have created a program that allows a player to play the "Rock Paper Scissors" game with the computer. The program should prompt the player to choose either rock, paper, or scissors, and then determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

To create the program, I used Python's built-in input function to get the player's choice and random function to get the computer's choice. And then I used a set of if/elif/else statements to determine the winner. I also used a while loop to allow the player to play multiple rounds of the game.
